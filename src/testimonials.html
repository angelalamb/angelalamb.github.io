        “Kathleen has been an amazing violin teacher to both of our kids for many years and is a great role model to
        them! She’s a talented violinist and the kids look up to her to do better. She’s fun, approachable, attentive,
        and tries different ideas and styles to facilitate their learning. We love Kathleen.”
        <br>

        “Ms. Kathleen has helped me grow as a violinist the most by simplifying difficult pieces in a way I understand
        the best. She’s patient, kind and fun.”
        <br>
        ~ Dania (middle school student)

        “Kathleen is a very talented violinist. Most importantly, she is a very talented violin teacher. I like her
        teaching style very much, encouraging but also strict. She knows how to encourage students to practice hard to
        reach a higher level; she knows how to instruct students to improve their violin techniques, and gives them the
        easiest and most effective ways to practice challenging technical skills. My son has studied violin with
        Kathleen for 4 years now, and I can see his steady progress every year. We are so happy to have Kathleen as his
        violin teacher.”

        “My daughter studied violin with Kathleen from age 3. Without reservation, the foundational years we spent in
        her studio contributed in large part to the young artist she is today. Kathleen approaches students with
        kindness, patience, a grounding in the Suzuki method, and with a keen interest in their development as whole
        persons.”
        <br>

        “Kathleen is kind, patient and professional with both children and adults. I highly recommend her for a teacher.
        You won’t find a more knowledgeable or enjoyable teacher. Both my daughter and I have taken lessons from her.”
        <br>
        ~ Valerie W.
        <br><br>
        “Ms. Kathleen has allowed me to get better at playing the violin in so many ways. She has allowed me to take my
        music level to all new heights with dynamics, bow techniques, playing styles, and much more.”
        <br>
