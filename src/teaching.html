    My teaching style is a blend of Suzuki and traditional methods with a focus on beautiful tone and expressive playing with a solid foundation of technique. I incorporate essentials of ear training, musicality, and good posture through a diverse music repertoire in order to give students a well-rounded musical education. At my private violin & violin studio near downtown Rochester, students receive weekly private lessons as well as group class instruction to work on ensemble skills. Students also have performance opportunities throughout the year.

    I teach students age 3 years - adult, beginning through advanced levels at my private violin & viola studio near downtown Rochester, MN. Students receive weekly private lessons as well as group class instruction to work on ensemble skills. Students also have performance opportunities throughout the year.
    <br><br>
    My teaching approach is individually tailored to fit each student’s needs and designed to cultivate their potential in a positive and nurturing environment that builds self-confidence, perseverance, and creativity. Using music as a medium, students will learn many skills applicable to life beyond their instrument including focus, confidence, communication, creativity, memorization, organization, teamwork, and as an outlet to express what cannot be said in words.
    <br><br>
    Above all, it is my mission to foster in each student a lifelong joy of music and its ability to enrich people’s lives. It is so fulfilling to see the individual growth and progress of each student in their personal musical journey.
